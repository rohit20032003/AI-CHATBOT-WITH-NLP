Chatbot with NLTK
This project demonstrates a simple chatbot implemented using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python. The chatbot uses predefined patterns and responses to engage in a basic text-based conversation with users.

Features
Responds to greetings like "Hi", "Hello", or "Hey".
Answers simple questions, such as "What is your name?" or "How are you?".
Shares information about its "favorite color".
Provides a default response for location-related queries.
Ends the conversation gracefully when the user types "quit".
